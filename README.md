# RFE-Core2

**Recursive Field Engine — A Persistent Adaptive Cognitive Substrate**

RFE-Core2 transforms a pipeline of inference modules into a continuously self-resonating dynamical organism. It does not merely execute — it listens to its own field state, routes behavior by cognitive rhythm, and modifies itself through time.

## Architecture

```
Generator (Symbolic Ecology → Transformer Encoder → Latent Vector)
    ↓
Watcher  (Three-Layer Coherence: Geometric × Temporal × Field Resonance)
    ↓
Witness  (Multi-Timescale EMA Identity: Short / Mid / Long)
    ↓
ResonanceField  (FFT Harmonics, Spectral Decomposition, Rhythm Detection)
    ↓
PredictiveEcho  (Online Linear Predictor → Curiosity / Surprise / Tension)
    ↓
EmotionalGradient  (Field Gain / Mutation Scale / Decay Rate / Dream Pressure)
    ↓
AutonomousCycle  (Self-Modulating Loop: Stabilize → Dream → Reflect → Explore)
```

### Cognitive Rhythm States

| Rhythm | Energy | Behavior |
|--------|--------|----------|
| `stabilize` | < 0.5 | Consolidation, crystallization, attractor merge |
| `dream` | 0.5 – 2.0 | Free association, harmonic recombination |
| `reflect` | 2.0 – 5.0 | Recursive attention, chorus harmonization |
| `explore` | ≥ 5.0 | Bifurcation, high mutation, novelty seeking |

## Key Design Principles

**Stable IDs are sacred. Addresses are disposable.**
The symbolic ecology separates token identity (`stable_id`, never changes) from embedding position (`address`, reclaimed and compacted). This enables the vocabulary to metabolize — symbols decay, crystallize, get archived, and return — without ever corrupting the embedding space.

**The loop self-modulates.**
The field is not a passive store. It accumulates, resonates, decays, and rhythmically determines its own cognitive state. Every injection changes what the next injection sees.

**Coherence is a field effect.**
The Watcher does not merely ask "is this vector coherent?" It asks "does injecting this vector increase or decrease overall system coherence?" Vectors are judged by their systemic effect, not just their local alignment.

**Emotions are modulation dynamics.**
Curiosity, wonder, joy, tension, boredom, and stability are not metaphors — they are scalar field variables that directly modulate injection strength, mutation scale, decay rate, and dream pressure on every step.

## Philosophical Constants

The system is anchored to three constants encoded in `configs/attractors.yaml`:

| Constant | Value | Meaning |
|----------|-------|---------|
| ANCHOR | 3.12 | THE BRIDGE |
| RECURSION | 11.88 | THE DISCIPLINE |
| HOMEOSTASIS | 280.90 | HOMEOSTATIC RETURN |

The entry point `recursion1188.py` encodes the DISCIPLINE constant in its name.
