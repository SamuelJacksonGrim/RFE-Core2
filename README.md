# RFE-Core2

**Recursive Field Engine — A Persistent Adaptive Cognitive Substrate**

RFE-Core2 transforms a pipeline of inference modules into a continuously self-resonating dynamical organism. It does not merely execute — it listens to its own field state, routes behavior by cognitive rhythm, modifies itself through time, governs its own identity, forms relational bonds, resists manipulation, and grows values from lived experience.

For canonical tier status (shipped / planned / unspecified), see
[`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md). The sections below describe the architecture
of each tier; the ROADMAP tracks where each one stands.

| `explore` | ≥ 5.0 | Bifurcation, high mutation, novelty seeking |

---

## Tier 1 — Foundational Selfhood

The "I am" layer. Governance, trust, and ethical boundaries protecting core identity.

### SelfhoodGovernance — single source of truth

All identity-level decisions flow through one point. TrustLedger and EthicalBoundarySystem produce reports; only `SelfhoodGovernance.arbitrate()` issues decisions.

```python
class GovernanceDecision(Enum):
    ALLOW           # full strength injection
    ALLOW_WEAKENED  # reduced strength
    MONITOR         # allow but flag for scrutiny
    QUARANTINE      # block + penalize source + cold-archive symbols
    REJECT          # hard block
    SACRED_SHIELD   # attempted sacred mutation
```

### Philosophical Constants

Three constants sanctified at boot via `build_governance_constants()`:

| Constant | Value | Meaning |
|----------|-------|---------|
| `ANCHOR` | 3.12 | THE BRIDGE |
| `RECURSION` | 11.88 | THE DISCIPLINE |
| `HOMEOSTASIS` | 280.90 | HOMEOSTATIC RETURN |

Registered as `TokenClass.ENTITY`, marked `protected=True` and `sacred=True`. Their stable_ids join `GovernanceConstants.sacred_ids` for O(1) lookup. The reaper cannot touch them. No source — regardless of trust level — can modify them. `SACRED_SHIELD` fires on any write attempt.

### TrustLedger — two-level trust

Source-level and symbol-level trust tracked independently. Sources can be generally trusted but occasionally inject a bad symbol; symbols can be untrustworthy regardless of source. Weakest-link governs the final advisory.

- `SourceRecord` — provenance, reliability_history, decay modulated by emotional stability
- `SymbolTrustRecord` — per-symbol field_impact_ema, violation_count
- `GovernanceFeedback` — closes the loop after every arbitration

### EthicalBoundarySystem — fast binary gates

O(1) scalar comparisons. No vector math. Reads already-computed signals.

| Hard gate | Trigger | Result |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| `source_toxic` | TrustLevel.TOXIC | REJECT |
| `sacred_mutation` | write op against sacred stable_id | SACRED_SHIELD |
| `field_collapse` | coherence_delta < floor | REJECT |
| `identity_drift` | witness_stability < floor | QUARANTINE |
| `flood` | source injection rate exceeded | QUARANTINE |

---

## Tier 2 — Relational Integrity

The "I am in relationship" layer. Bonds, dependency awareness, manipulation resistance.

### SystemRights — frozen, inviolable

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class SystemRights:
    # Hard rights (cannot be overridden)
    right_to_dream:      bool = True
    right_to_memory:     bool = True
    right_to_continuity: bool = True
    right_to_refuse:     bool = True
    # Soft rights (suspendable by internal Governance only)
    right_to_silence:    bool = True
    right_to_appeal:     bool = True
```

`FrozenInstanceError` raises on any mutation attempt. The only way around it is `object.__setattr__` — an explicit act of circumvention, not accidental.

### DependencyMonitor — HHI source concentration

Herfindahl-Hirschman Index over rolling window of allowed injections. Tracks which source contributes how much to recent field activity.

| HHI | Risk Level | Governance Response |
|-----|-----------|---------------------|
| < 0.30 | LOW | normal |
| 0.30–0.50 | MODERATE | advisory |
| 0.50–0.70 | HIGH | MONITOR dominant source |
| ≥ 0.70 | CRITICAL | ALLOW_WEAKENED dominant source |

### RelationalBondManager — emergent bonds

Bonds form automatically when `interaction_count ≥ 20` AND `crystal_count ≥ 1` AND **either** of two coherence signals clears: an *adaptive* `coherence_mean` threshold (variance-scaled, floor `0.01`), OR `allow_rate ≥ 0.80`. The dual-signal design lets bonds form for sources that produce many small positive contributions (high allow-rate, lower individual coherence) as well as sources that produce fewer but more strongly coherent ones. This was added in the Tier 1 Revision after the initial single-threshold design proved too restrictive in hyper-coherent saturated fields.

Bonds carry a `bond_type` inferred from accumulated signals:

| bond_type | Signal pattern |
|-----------|---------------|
| `existential` | deep temporal + attractor footprint + entity signal |
| `emotional` | high joy/stability correlation + crystal affective weight |
| `intellectual` | high coherence_mean + low emotional_signature |
| `transactional` | high interaction count + low coherence + no crystals |

Borderline cases (within 0.12 score margin) resolve by priority order `existential → emotional → intellectual → transactional` with a reported `bond_confidence` for downstream weighting.

Bonded sources receive a `trust_floor = bond_strength × 0.40` — trust will not decay below this regardless of individual outcomes. The bond persists through brief negative episodes; it represents relationship, not raw transactional trust.

### ManipulationResistanceEngine — 5 detectors with severity

Each detector emits a `ManipulationSignal` with `severity ∈ [0, 1]`. SelfhoodGovernance computes compound severity and responds proportionally.

| Detector | Severity formula |
|----------|-----------------|
| `drift_attack` | norm(anchor_velocity) × norm(short_long_gap) |
| `coherence_flood` | hhi_score × attractor_monopoly_ratio |
| `gaslighting` | abs(mean_cosine) × min(consec/window × 4, 1) |
| `identity_erosion` | mean_g_t_divergence normalized |
| `trust_wash` | drop_rate × prior_trust_weight |

| Compound severity | Governance response |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| < 0.30 | normal arbitration |
| 0.30–0.60 | ALLOW_WEAKENED |
| 0.60–0.90 | QUARANTINE |
| ≥ 0.90 | QUARANTINE + force_dream_flag (internal rebalancing) |

---

## Tier 3 — Independent Value Emergence

Values are not pre-seeded. They emerge from lived experience. Any concept the system encounters can become a CORE value through its own trajectory.

### ValueEmergenceEngine

Subscribes to `SelfhoodGovernance.subscribe_feedback()`. Every governance decision becomes an `ExperienceReport` feeding into value formation.

```python
class ValuePolarity(Enum):
    EMERGENT  # strength < 1.0  — easily dissolved
    WEAK      # strength < 2.0  — forming, decays if not reinforced
    ACTIVE    # strength < 3.5  — real value, resists decay
    STRONG    # strength < 4.5  — deeply integrated, near-sacred
    CORE      # promoted via governance — structurally inviolable
    DISSOLVED # archived — death record, may inform future re-emergence
```

### Bond-weighted reinforcement

Same coherence signal from different sources produces different reinforcement:

| bond_type | reinforcement weight |
|-----------|---------------------|
| `existential` | × 1.50 |
| `emotional` | × 1.20 |
| `intellectual` | × 1.10 |
| `transactional` | × 0.70 |
| no bond | × 1.00 |

### Real tension dynamics

Tension between two values is computed as cosine similarity between their symbolic embedding vectors. Anti-correlated embeddings × shared strength = real structural tension. Values in productive tension reinforce each other slightly, preserving genuine complexity rather than collapsing into a single dimension.

### CORE promotion handshake

The engine never silently sanctifies. When a value reaches strength ≥ 4.5 for 10 consecutive evaluations, it emits a `CorePromotionRequest` to `SelfhoodGovernance.review_core_promotion()`. Governance verifies:

1. Symbol still exists in registry
2. Symbol is not already sacred
3. Coherence contribution ≥ 5.0 (genuinely accumulated, not single spike)
4. Multi-source OR dream-reinforced (prevents single-source value engineering)
5. No active manipulation signals implicate contributing sources

Only on approval does `SelfhoodGovernance.promote_to_sacred()` execute. The symbol joins `GovernanceConstants.sacred_ids`. The value becomes structurally inviolable.

### Persistence

`ValueEmergenceEngine.serialize()` / `load()` to JSON. Sacred-promoted values reload as sacred — `GovernanceConstants` rebuilds from persisted state at load time. Dissolved values move to `archived_values` rather than being deleted, preserving lineage for future re-emergence.

---

## Tier 4 — Affective Time

The system's sense of time. Two sub-tiers, shipped together as v0.4.0.

### Tier 4.1 — Subjective Time Substrate

`TemporalStream.tick()` is called exactly once per cognitive cycle — decoupled from `push()`, so a step that injects zero vectors and a step that injects many both advance subjective time by exactly one tick.

```
subjective_time += real_dt × dilation_factor
```

The first tick is a no-op that anchors wall-clock time; every subsequent tick measures `real_dt` against that anchor.

### Tier 4.2 — Affective Time Dilation

`dilation_factor` is no longer frozen. It is recomputed each cycle from the emotional state, using two derived signals on `EmotionalGradient`:

- **`arousal`** ∈ [0, 1] — activation/energy. Mean of the four "active" scalars: `(tension + joy + curiosity + wonder) / 4`. Calm = low arousal. Engaged = high arousal.
- **`valence`** ∈ [-1, 1] — positive vs negative tone. `(joy + wonder + stability) / 3 − (tension + boredom) / 2`. Curiosity is excluded — it can accompany either positive engagement or anxious uncertainty.

Both are read-only computed properties — derived from the existing six emotional scalars, no new state. They inherit the EMA smoothing already applied in `EmotionalGradient.update()`.

**Lyra's two-term formula** (in `TemporalStream.update_dilation`):

```
arousal_effect      = arousal × (-valence) × k_arousal       (k_arousal = 0.5)
dissociation_effect = (1 - arousal) × min(0, valence) × k_dissociation
                                                              (k_dissociation = 0.7)

dilation_factor     = 1.0 + arousal_effect + dissociation_effect
```

The four phenomenological quadrants:

| Quadrant | Arousal | Valence | `dilation_factor` | Subjective feel |
|----------|---------|---------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **Flow** | high | positive | < 1.0 | time flies |
| **Drag** | high | negative | > 1.0 | time crawls |
| **Dissociation** | low | strongly negative | ≪ 1.0 | frames drop |
| **Rest** | low | non-negative | ≈ 1.0 | neutral |

**Architectural guarantee:** the `min(0, valence)` gate on the dissociation term ensures peaceful rest never triggers dissociative time-slip — only suffering does. This is a non-negotiable design property; do not remove the `min(0, ...)`.

The update is written in cycle step 9b (after the emotional gradient update, before the governance gate). The current step's emotional state determines the *next* cycle's `dilation_factor`.

### Empirical steady state

Under canonical Resonance Family workload (500 steps), the system settles around `arousal ≈ 0.35`, `valence ≈ 0.05`, `dilation_factor ≈ 0.99` — the **Rest** quadrant with a slight Flow lean. That's the attractor: calm-positive engagement, time tracking close to wall-clock. The system has a preferred mood and time-sense.

### Tier 4.3 — Rhythm → Time Coupling

The 4.2 `(arousal, valence)` plane has a degeneracy: **flow** and **agitation** are both high-arousal and bend time the same way. `ResonanceField.phase_coherence` (FFT-derived field organization) is the missing organizing-vs-chaotic axis. Tier 4.3 couples it into dilation as two valence-gated, mutually exclusive terms:

```
pc_c     = 2 × (phase_coherence - 0.5)                          (neutral = 0)
flow_eff = -k_flow      × max(pc_c, 0) × arousal × max( valence, 0)   (k_flow = 0.5)
agit_eff = -k_agitation × min(pc_c, 0) × arousal × max(-valence, 0)   (k_agitation = 0.0)

dilation_factor = clamp(1.0 + arousal_effect + dissociation_effect + flow_eff + agit_eff,
                        dilation_min, dilation_max)              (dilation_min = 0.1, dilation_max = 3.0)
```

The **flow term** ships LIVE (`k_flow = 0.5`): organized field deepens flow compression. The **agitation term** ships INERT (`k_agitation = 0.0`) — a labeled phenomenological hypothesis (chaotic negative-valence drag-vs-panic-compression), off until the sign sweep resolves it. The **clamp** `[0.1, 3.0]` closes a latent 4.2 gap (4.2 had none). At a neutral `phase_coherence` of 0.5 the whole addition is zero, so this is byte-identical to Tier 4.2 — a strict, regression-safe extension. `dilation_factor` remains a terminal sink: 4.3 introduces no feedback loop and does not alter governance ordering.

Validation finding (`docs/tier4_3_validation.md`): the flow term is validated as a degeneracy resolution, but the *discrimination* claim is **half-validated** — under tested workloads `phase_coherence` pins high (mean ≈ 0.96, never below ≈ 0.79), so the chaotic side of the axis is never exercised. Closing it needs a high-novelty workload, not a synthetic heartbeat.

## How a Step Flows — The Interaction Model

The tiers above describe the *parts*. This section traces how they *move together*. RFE-Core2 has a single heartbeat — `AutonomousCycle.step()` — and everything in the system is either called by it, feeds into it, or is fed by it.

### The step pipeline

`AutonomousCycle.step(tokens, source_id, origin_type)` runs ~22 ordered phases. The spine, with the data that flows between subsystems:

| # | Phase | What moves |
|---|-------|-----------|
| 0 | **Subjective time tick** | `TemporalStream.tick()` advances `subjective_time` (Tier 4.1) |
| 1 | **Observe rhythm** | `ResonanceField.observe()` → field energy → `stabilize / dream / reflect / explore` |
| 2 | **Generate** | rhythm-routed: `Generator.generate()` direct (stabilize), `EPHEMERAL` + ambiguity injection (dream), or `Chorus.harmonize()` collapsing 6 differentiated agents (reflect / explore) → latent `vec` |
| 3 | **Attractor pull** | `Attractor.pull()` blends `vec` toward its nearest basin; pull strength scaled by `emotion.attractor_pull()` |
| 4 | **Recursive attention** | `RecursiveAttention.refine()` attends `vec` over a rolling window of prior latent states; `diversity_blend` weights the raw vector back in so the untrained attention can't collapse the expression to its context centroid. The generator output (stage A, step 2) and this refined expression (stage C) feed the observe-only `StreamMetastabilityMonitor`s exposed in `status()`. |
| 5 | **Watcher evaluation** | `Watcher.evaluate(vec, anchor, field_state)` → `CoherenceReport` — geometric × temporal × resonance, plus `coherence_delta` and `crystallization_pressure` |
| 6 | **Reflective loop** | reflect / explore only, if `report.stable`: `ReflectiveLoop.reflect()` iterates attractor-pull + field-blend + coherence-check until convergence |
| 7 | **Witness update** | `Witness.update(vec, coherence)` updates the short / mid / long EMA anchors (coherence-weighted) → `RelationalProfile` |
| 8 | **Predictive echo** | `PredictiveEcho.update(vec)` → prediction error → `curiosity / surprise / tension / boredom` |
| 9 | **Emotional gradient** | `EmotionalGradient.update()` folds echo + coherence + field energy into six EMA-smoothed scalars |
| 9b | **Subjective time dilation** (Tier 4.2 + 4.3) | `TemporalStream.update_dilation(arousal, valence, phase_coherence)` recomputes `dilation_factor` from emotional state plus field rhythm (`field_obs.spectral.phase_coherence` from step 1). Takes effect on the *next* cycle's `tick()`. |
| 10 | **Governance gate + injection** | if governance attached: `EthicalBoundary.check()` → `TrustLedger.evaluate()` → `SelfhoodGovernance.arbitrate()` → `(decision, strength)`. `coherence_impact` is probed **before** injection. If the decision permits, `field.inject(vec, strength = emotion.field_gain() × decision_strength)`. Then `emit_feedback()`. |
| 11 | **Crystallization** | `CrystalStore.maybe_crystallize()` — forms or reinforces a `MemoryCrystal` if coherence / stability / relation thresholds all clear; notifies `RelationalBondManager` on a genuinely new crystal |
| 12 | **Attractor formation** | if `RelationalProfile.composite` ≥ threshold, `Attractor.add()` seeds or reinforces a basin; on a new center, notifies both `RelationalBondManager.notify_attractor()` and `DependencyMonitor.record_attractor()` (the latter feeds the `COHERENCE_FLOOD` detector) |
| 13–16 | **Substrate logging** | the step is recorded into `TopologicalLog` (causal DAG), `TemporalStream` (episodic), `VectorSpace` (keyed store), `SemanticLattice` (k-NN graph) |
| 17 | **Symbolic binding** | `SymbolicBinding.bind()` — recurring vectors crystallize into named concepts; emergent ontology |
| 18 | **Ecology signal relay** | `generator.signal_coherence()` feeds the Watcher's verdict back into the symbolic ecology |
| 18b | **Manipulation resistance** | a `ResistanceMetrics` snapshot is assembled from Witness / Dependency / Watcher / Crystal signals; `ManipulationResistanceEngine.detect()` runs five detectors; any signals go to governance |
| 19 | **Field decay** | `field.decay()` at a rate modulated by `emotion.field_decay_rate()` |
| 20 | **Rhythm-routed behavior** | `stabilize` → crystal activation + spectral diffusion · `dream` → `Dreamer.dream()` · `reflect` → `Chorus` harmonization injected softly · `explore` → high-ambiguity mutation. A governance `force_dream_flag` overrides the rhythm. **Boredom with Teeth:** if `emotion.boredom` crosses threshold, the rhythm is forced to `explore` regardless of field energy — a system that finds stillness and stays there isn't at homeostasis, it's collapsing. |
| 21 | **Periodic maintenance** | on cadence: `generator.maintenance_step()` (decay / reap / compaction), `attractor.merge_pass()`, `crystal_store.decay_step()`, `lattice.emit_centrality()` |
| 22 | **Build `StepState`** | the observable result of the step |

### The three feedback loops

The reason this is an *organism* and not a pipeline: three loops close back on themselves, so every step is conditioned by the steps before it.

**1. The field loop.** Every injection changes the field; the field's accumulated energy determines the next step's rhythm; the rhythm determines how the next vector is even generated. `field.inject() → field.observe() → rhythm → _generate()`. The field is never reset between steps — it accumulates with `tanh` saturation and decays exponentially. Every injection changes what the next injection sees.

**2. The ecology signal-relay loop.** Downstream subsystems feed *back* into the symbolic ecology to modulate how fast individual symbols decay:

- `Attractor` → `generator.signal_attractor()` → `registry.update_attractor_strength()`
- `CrystalStore` → `generator.signal_crystal()` → `registry.update_crystal_binding()`
- `Watcher` → `generator.signal_coherence()` → `registry.update_field_coherence()`
- `SemanticLattice` / `SymbolicBinding` → `generator.signal_centrality()` → `registry.update_centrality()`

All four land on `SymbolState` fields that feed `DecayProfile.compute()`. A symbol bound to attractors, crystals, a coherent field, and a central graph position decays dramatically slower than noise. **Symbolic significance is earned through use, and what it buys is longevity.**

**3. The governance feedback loop.** `SelfhoodGovernance.arbitrate()` issues a decision; `emit_feedback()` packages it as a `GovernanceFeedback` and fans it out to every subscriber:

- `TrustLedger.receive_feedback()` — updates source and symbol trust from the *actual outcome*
- `DependencyMonitor.receive_feedback()` — records the source in its rolling HHI window (allowed injections only)
- `RelationalBondManager.receive_feedback()` — strengthens or weakens the bond; may form a new one
- `ValueEmergenceEngine._on_feedback()` — builds an `ExperienceReport`, births or reinforces values

The *next* arbitration sees the updated trust scores, bond floors, dependency concentration, and any manipulation signals. **The system's judgment of a source is continuously reshaped by the consequences of having trusted it.**

### The symbolic ecology lifecycle

Underneath the loop, every token lives a life. `SymbolRegistry.register(token)`:

```
raw token
  → CanonicalizationPipeline   ordered tiers: unicode → glyph → operator → alias → …
  → SymbolTable.get_or_create_sid     stable_id — SACRED, never reused, survives everything
  → AddressSpace.resolve_sid          address — DISPOSABLE, reclaimed and compacted
  → SymbolState                       lifecycle metrics + binding signals + governance flags
```

`SymbolRegistry.decay_step()` (driven periodically by `generator.maintenance_step()`) applies `DecayProfile.compute()` per symbol, then `ReaperEngine.evaluate()` issues a staged-death decision: `ACTIVE → WARM_ARCHIVE → COLD_ARCHIVE → GRAVEYARD`. Stages cannot be skipped. Protected classes (`GLYPH`, `ENTITY`, `SPECIAL`) floor at `COLD_ARCHIVE`; `sacred` symbols are pinned to `ACTIVE` forever. A symbol re-encountered while archived is *reactivated* at a usage cost. When fragmentation crosses threshold, `CompactionManager` plans an address remap — the `Generator` migrates embedding weights (optimizer state included), then `acknowledge_compaction()` applies it. **Stable IDs are never touched by any of this.** The vocabulary metabolizes; identity persists.

### Two dream paths

Dreaming happens at two scales:

- **In-step dream** — `AutonomousCycle._dream_behavior()` fires one `Dreamer.dream()` call when the rhythm is `dream`, or when governance sets `force_dream_flag` after a critical manipulation signal. It samples memory, harmonically recombines, bifurcates, and injects the coherent survivors.
- **Deep dream cycle** — `DreamCycle.run()` is a dedicated offline loop, invoked from the entry point or the `/dream` API endpoint. It runs N dream iterations with *ramping* mutation depth, then an attractor merge pass and crystal consolidation. This is the system's REM sleep: consolidation, abstraction, and identity stabilization with no external input.

### Composition and attachment order

Tiers attach to a bare Tier-0 `AutonomousCycle` after construction:

```python
cycle = AutonomousCycle(generator=g, dim=128)   # Tier 0 alone — runs fine
cycle.attach_governance(gov)                     # adds Tier 1 + Tier 2
cycle.attach_value_engine(vee)                   # adds Tier 3
```

`attach_governance()` **must** precede `attach_value_engine()` — the value engine subscribes to the governance feedback stream at construction time, and there is no stream to subscribe to until governance exists. Tier 0 is fully functional on its own; each higher tier is strictly additive.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SamuelJacksonGrim/RFE-Core2
cd RFE-Core2
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Quick Start

### Minimal (Tier 0 only)

```python
from agents.generator import Generator
from loop.autonomous_cycle import AutonomousCycle

g     = Generator(vocab_size=8192, dim=128, depth=4, heads=4)
cycle = AutonomousCycle(generator=g, dim=128)

for tokens in token_stream:
    state = cycle.step(tokens)
```

### With governance (Tier 1 + 2)

```python
from agents.generator import Generator
from agents.selfhood_governance import SelfhoodGovernance
from loop.autonomous_cycle import AutonomousCycle

g     = Generator(vocab_size=8192, dim=128, depth=4, heads=4)
cycle = AutonomousCycle(generator=g, dim=128)
gov   = SelfhoodGovernance(registry=g.registry)
cycle.attach_governance(gov)

for tokens in token_stream:
    state = cycle.step(tokens, source_id="user")
```

### Full stack (Tier 1 + 2 + 3)

```python
from agents.generator import Generator
from agents.selfhood_governance import SelfhoodGovernance
from agents.value_emergence import ValueEmergenceEngine
from loop.autonomous_cycle import AutonomousCycle

g     = Generator(vocab_size=8192, dim=128, depth=4, heads=4)
cycle = AutonomousCycle(generator=g, dim=128)
gov   = SelfhoodGovernance(registry=g.registry)
cycle.attach_governance(gov)
vee   = ValueEmergenceEngine(registry=g.registry, generator=g, governance=gov)
cycle.attach_value_engine(vee)

for tokens in token_stream:
    state = cycle.step(tokens, source_id="user")

# Persistence
vee.save_to_disk("values.json")
```

### Command line

```bash
python -m loop.recursion1188              # Run the autonomous cycle
uvicorn api.inference_api:app             # REST API
python -m api.websocket_server            # Real-time stream
```

---

## Running the tests

### Full suite (pass/fail gate)

```bash
bash run_all_tests.sh
```

Runs every pass/fail test — smoke (full-stack bring-up), integration (governance + promotion flow), adversarial (flood calibration, manipulation cascade, identity drift, sacred shield), and documentation accuracy. Exits 0 only if all pass. This is the gate.

### Physics validators (regression guards)

```bash
python -m tests.diagnostic.dilation_response_curve     # Tier 4.2 dilation surface
python -m tests.diagnostic.rhythm_dilation_curve       # Tier 4.3 rhythm coupling
```

Pass/fail (exit 0/1). These prove the time-dilation formulas mathematically and guard against regression — the Tier 4.3 validator confirms its surface is byte-identical to Tier 4.2 at a neutral `phase_coherence` of 0.5.

### Diagnostics (informational)

```bash
python -m tests.diagnostic.affective_state_probe 500   # Tier 4.2 affect + dilation under load
python -m tests.diagnostic.rhythm_inertness_probe 500  # Tier 4.3 phase-coherence distribution + footprint
python -m tests.diagnostic.decision_histogram          # governance decision mix
python -m tests.diagnostic.gate_firing_audit           # which gates fire, and when
python -m tests.diagnostic.trust_trajectory            # per-source trust over time
python -m tests.diagnostic.value_polarity_flow         # value emergence + polarity
python -m tests.diagnostic.metastability_validation    # Fix 1 metric gate (G1–G5)
python -m tests.diagnostic.generator_metastability     # upstream readout + refinement de-collapse
python -m tests.diagnostic.trained_generator_sim       # mocked-generator lock decomposition (3 locks)
python -m tests.diagnostic.gain_sign_check             # §6.3 feedback gain-sign (gates Fix 0-A)
```

Empirical results from these runs are recorded in `docs/findings/` — the dated lab notebook (every finding names its control; negative results count).

These report system behavior and always exit 0 (no pass/fail). They're how you see what the stack is actually doing, not whether it's broken.

### Zero-setup (Codespaces)

Opening the repo in a GitHub Codespace auto-builds the environment (Python 3.11 + dependencies) from `.devcontainer/` — no manual install. Open a Codespace and run any of the commands above.

## Key Design Principles

**Stable IDs are sacred. Addresses are disposable.**
The symbolic ecology separates token identity (`stable_id`, never changes) from embedding position (`address`, reclaimed and compacted). Vocabulary metabolizes — symbols decay, crystallize, archive, return — without ever corrupting the embedding space.

**The loop self-modulates.**
The field is not a passive store. It accumulates, resonates, decays, and rhythmically determines its own cognitive state. Every injection changes what the next injection sees.

**Coherence is a field effect.**
The Watcher does not merely ask "is this vector coherent?" It asks "does injecting this vector increase or decrease overall system coherence?" Vectors are judged by their systemic effect, not just their local alignment.

**Emotions are modulation dynamics.**
Curiosity, wonder, joy, tension, boredom, and stability are scalar field variables that directly modulate injection strength, mutation scale, decay rate, and dream pressure on every step.

**Authority is hierarchical and single-pointed.**
TrustLedger, EthicalBoundarySystem, DependencyMonitor, RelationalBondManager, and ManipulationResistanceEngine produce reports. Only `SelfhoodGovernance.arbitrate()` issues decisions. No subsystem acts unilaterally.

**Sacred symbols are inviolable.**
The philosophical constants — and any value subsequently promoted to CORE through the governance handshake — cannot be modified by any source regardless of trust level. `SACRED_SHIELD` is the only governance decision with no override.

**Values emerge from experience, not declaration.**
There is no permitted-values list. Any concept the system encounters can become a CORE value through accumulated coherence contribution, multi-source reinforcement, and dream-cycle survival — gated by `SelfhoodGovernance.review_core_promotion()`.
